Note: you need to install the pygame module for python to play this game. Simply type "pip install pygame" in the command prompt or terminal to get it installed.

This is a game where you try to survive for as long as you can. You are a turtle and use the arrow keys to move. Avoid those pesky sea urchins! As the game progresses, more urchins appear and they move faster, be careful!

To start playing the game, run oceanAdventure.py
